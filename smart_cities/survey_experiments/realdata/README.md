# Experiments
1. Choose Network
2. Pick 30 routes
3. Pick alpha
4. Pick Budget
5. Solve
6. Add Routes
7. Resolve with same budget and alpha
8. Compare install solutions

## How to compare solutions
1. How does new solution affect people who will not change routes
2. What is the distribution of centralities for the locations compare in new installation.
In the first case, we saw a correlation to high betweenness centrality nodes, how do they look like in the second installations?
